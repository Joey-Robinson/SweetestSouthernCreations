// Start the actual layout: Set the grid up.
  // Find a better solution for Routes.js -> className="Home". Having to recycle a component when I don't want to is shit.
// Add the Modal: Take modal from CSSGridStuf and import it here
// Take Full DummyComponent/RotatingCard: Take the CSS so there's a top and bottom portion, not the entire thing.
// Design the menu: Clean it up, make it look better with hover effects
  // Find SVG's to use
// Add more Routes: Create and add Components for routing and display
  // Work, Requests, anything else
// Look into any external libraries needed: Material-UI would be one of the only ones
// Add FavIcon: Request something for FavIcon so it can be added (Do it yourself)

// Modal: Using a button inside of the Modal itself results in the button (opening button)
// Not being able to be moved. So this means, even using a Button component (see file structure)
// I would have to retrace my steps to see the best way to fix this. Very interesting and I want to 
// Figure out the best way to handle this in the future

// Contact Page: Add a DnD/Todo type list for all contact information.
  // This is done. I instead added an accordion.

// Add/Research lazy loading for react. When I go to add the images, make sure you have at least 2 per, so you can use 
// varying sizes?
// Possibly research a way to pull images from somewhere. Last time the images felt sluggish. Find what causes this.
// There's a possibility that I'll need to srcSet the Work.js images. After I've deployed, I'll 
// Assess the website and then determine that.
// Add lazy loading. 

// About.js: Update the <p></p> tag to have text-align: center; That shit is mad annoying.


// Possible for pre-deployment: Make a reusable button component. I don't think it matters for this, but I'd like to see
// If I could cut down on the amount of code I have floating around.
