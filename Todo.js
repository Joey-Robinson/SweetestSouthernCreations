// Start the actual layout: Set the grid up.
  // Find a better solution for Routes.js -> className="Home". Having to recycle a component when I don't want to is shit.
// Add the Modal: Take modal from CSSGridStuf and import it here
// Take Full DummyComponent/RotatingCard: Take the CSS so there's a top and bottom portion, not the entire thing.
// Design the menu: Clean it up, make it look better with hover effects
// Add more Routes: Create and add Components for routing and display
  // Work, Requests, anything else
// Look into any external libraries needed: Material-UI would be on of the only ones
// -: ~
// Add FavIcon: Request something for FavIcon so it can be added (Do it yourself)
