# Sweetest Southern Creations

I created this website for a friend and her business. I started this original project a while back. [The first iteration](https://github.com/elamahpla/SweetSouthernCreations) wasn't something I was too excited about, personally. So I decided to restart the entire process.

# Version One:

[Version One](https://github.com/elamahpla/SweetSouthernCreations) was my first pass at the site. It was too busy without accomplishing much. I felt like there was a lot of unwarranted additions in the project that didn't say or DO much. So, I scraped the idea and started fresh using [Lean Plate SCSS](https://github.com/elamahpla/LeanPlateSCSS). I wanted to go in without much and do as much as I could without installing external libraries. 

# Version Two: 

[Version Two](https://github.com/elamahpla/SweetestSouthernCreations/commits/master?after=7bcd8a9a0b66667e6950944e99ebd96d90d3ceee+69) was the second pass. Again, I felt like I got carried away with what I was trying to accomplish. I was attempting to be overly minimal with no actual reasoning. The clientele of this website and this type of product aren't overly concerned with the aesthetics, they want to see the product(s) they're going to be buying or the product(s) they're going to think about buying. I also feel like I didn't put a lot of effort into this and [Version One.](https://github.com/elamahpla/SweetSouthernCreations) I felt like I was just simply going through the motions, instead of actually being excited about making something.

# Version Three - Final: 
[Version Three.](https://github.com/elamahpla/SweetestSouthernCreations) Yes, this is what I was going for. Something 'bubbly' but with modern technologies (CSS Grid throughout a majority of the site,for example). I was **actually** excited to work on this. I had built everything up myself instead of relying on external libraries, which I think added a sense of accomplishment to everything. I still have some issues that I'm concerned about (check the [_about.scss](https://github.com/elamahpla/SweetestSouthernCreations/blob/master/src/sass/pages/_about.scss)) and I'll try to address the best I can, but I feel not only confident about this but comfortable with what I made.
